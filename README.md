# AGTF30

The Advanced Geared Turbofan 30,000 (AGTF30) is a geared turbofan 
simulation that utilizes the Toolbox for the Modeling and Analysis 
of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS) to create a steady-state and 
dynamic engine model within MATLAB/Simulink. The engine model is 
based upon a futuristic geared turbofan concept and allows steady-state 
operation throughout the flight envelope. Dynamic operation is 
utilizes a baseline control system.
Design tools included within the package include system linearization and
automated plotting scripts.

AGTF30 installation:
1) Install Matlab and Simulink, Developed in MATLAB 2015aSP1
2) Install the Toolbox for the Modeling and Analyais of Thermodyanmic Systems,
developed with T-MATS version 1.3 (https://github.com/nasa/T-MATS/releases)

Running AGTF30 simulation:
1) Navigate to the AGTF30 folder
3) Run script "setup_everything.m",  this will generate all required variables within MATLAB 
(namely: bus variables and the engine parameter structure 'MWS'). 
4) Open AGTF30 system simualtion: dynamic(Dyn), Linearization (Lin), or steady-state (SS).
5) Run the specified model.

Changing run conditions:

Open setup_everyting and adjust Input.  structure as appropriate

or

Verify setup_everything sets Input.UseExcel = 1, update excel document define_inputs.xlsx

or

Verify setup_everything sets Input.UseExcel = 0, update define_inputs.m

System inputs are defined (within the MWS structure) as vectors with each value matching with a time vector.
The linearization and steady-state systems will only make use of the initial values, 
Note: Linearization and Dynamic systems will use the steady-state solver to generate initial conditions.

Outputs:
1) Steady state simulation outputs structure: out_SS, containing a large amount of data. Additionally it generate specific structures out_*
2) Linearization simulation outputs structure: out_Lin, containing a large amount of data. (ABCD matricies for state-space model are located within the structure)
3) Dynamic simulation outputs structure: out_Dyn, containing a large amount of data. Additionally it generate specific structures out_*

Auto plotting scripts:

The AGTF30 makes use of T-MATS autoplotting scrips. These are defined within PlotDyn.m and PlotSS.m.
After running the Dyn model or SS model, run the appropriate script to generate the appropriate plots.
